Assignment: Build a React Native To-Do App with User Authentication

Objective: The purpose of this assignment is to assess your understanding of React Native fundamentals and your ability to create a functional mobile application with user authentication. Creativity in design and the inclusion of additional features are highly encouraged.

Instructions:

1. Task Description: Build a To-Do list application for Mobile application using React Native CLI. (with TypeScript )The app should allow users to:

   - Register for an account with an email and password.
   - Log in with their registered credentials.
   - Add tasks with a title, description, date-time, deadline and priority .
   - Mark tasks as completed.
   - Delete tasks.
   - View a list of tasks with their status.

2. Technical Requirements: 

   - Use React Native CLI for building the app.
   - Implement user authentication (you can use libraries like Firebase Authentication or implement a basic authentication system).
   - Implement state management (you can choose between React's built-in state or a state management library like Redux).
   - Use appropriate components for UI elements like buttons, lists, and input fields.
   - Ensure a clean and organized project structure.
   - Include comments in your code to explain important sections.

3. Bonus (Optional): If you want to showcase additional skills, consider:

   - Adding task due dates.
   - Sort with time and deadline and priority mix algorithm.
   - Implementing task categories or tags.
   - Implementing sorting or filtering tasks.
   - Designing a visually appealing user interface with special consideration for cool and creative design.
   - Implementing any additional features you believe would enhance the app's functionality or user experience.
   - Creating a backend API using Node.js or Nest.js with MongoDB as the database


Evaluation Criteria:

- Correctness: Does the app perform the basic functionalities correctly, including user registration and login?
- Code Quality: Is the code well-structured and easy to understand?
- User Interface: Is the app visually appealing with special consideration for cool design?
- State Management: How effectively is state managed within the app?
- Authentication Flow: How well is user registration, login, and backend integration implemented (if applicable)?
- Bonus Features (if implemented): Extra points for creativity and problem-solving.
